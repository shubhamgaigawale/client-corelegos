            <p>
              We strongly advocate and implement an automate-everything mindset
              to transform our customer workplace. Our resources have solved
              many obstacles and saved our customers tens of thousands of
              dollars in direct and in-direct cost saving by introducing
              automation in areas ranging from business process automation to
              test automation. Also in these efforts our focus has been on
              utilizing open source toolsets to reduce license costs for
              customers.
