              Our resources are currently working closely with multiple federal
              and commercial clients to transform them into a Agile DevSecOps
              product centric organization. With our help, customers have
              realized benefits such as reduced mean-time to production,
              increased deployment frequency, fully automated risk
              characterization and software updates and patching at the speed of
              operations. Implementing DevSecOps unlocks the potential to
              utilize rapid development and testing through CI/CD pipelines and
              ease of implementing security and compliance in your applications.
